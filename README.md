The Moonbeam XCM SDK enables developers to easily transfer assets between chains, either between parachains or between a parachain and the relay chain, within the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

Additionally, the Moonbeam MRL SDK enables developers to easily transfer liquidity into and across the Polkadot ecosystem from other ecosystems like Ethereum. It uses the XCM SDK as base and adds the necessary functions to support MRL.
